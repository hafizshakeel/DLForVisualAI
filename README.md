# DLForVisualAI

In this repository, I will share my insights and implementations related to deep learning, particularly focusing on visual data.

## NN BASICS
This folder contains beginner implementations using PyTorch of different neural networks:
1. A simple fully connected network (NN)
2. A simple fully convolutional network (CNN)
3. Transfer learning using a pre-trained VGG16 model and GoogLeNet model

In addition, I've added the complete setup for the whole training process. You will find code for how to load online and custom datasets, define paths for training, validation, and testing datasets, set hyperparameters, train models, find optimal parameters, and visualize results using TensorBoard. Later, I will add the code for testing the model and computing metrics. This setup will be used to train the upcoming intermediate to advanced neural network architectures. I also added detailed comments for readability and a better understanding of the code.

## CNN ARCHITECTURES
This folder contains implementations of popular convolutional neural network architectures using PyTorch in the simplest form, including __LeNet__, __AlexNet__, __VGG__, __GoogLeNet__, and __ResNet__. Later, I plan to include a complete setup for training, validation, and testing of different architectures, along with pre-trained weights.

## GENERATIVE ADVERSARIAL NETWORKS
This folder contains implementations of popular Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) using PyTorch in the simplest form, starting from: **Simple GAN**, **DCGAN**, **WGAN**, **WGAN-GP**, **Pix2Pix**, **CycleGAN**, **ProGAN**, **SRGAN**, **ESRGAN**. Later, I plan to include a complete setup for training, validation, and testing of different architectures, along with pre-trained weights.
